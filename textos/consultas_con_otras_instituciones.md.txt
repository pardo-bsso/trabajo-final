## Evan Foss (Eaton Peabody Lab):

> Thermal mass can really help in these situations.


## DJ Delorie (Red Hat Inc):

> I use a thermocouple to monitor my woodstove, but I don't care so much
> about precision.  I use a DS2760 thermocouple kit from Parallax for
> it, and a high-temp thermocouple probe from Omega.com.

> For monitoring my geothermal system, I used RTDs and an MCU's ADC to

> times and averaging, and the tech who calibrated my geothermal system
> says they're spot-on.

> 0.3 deg C is close to the tolerances of thermocouples you can buy,

> in that range also.


## John Doty ([Noqsi Aerospace, ltd](http://www.noqsi.com/)):

> For focal plane temperature control at -90±0.1C on the Suzaku x-ray observatory, I used a Pt100 RTD with a commercial
> 20 bit delta-sigma ADC. In an FPGA, a PID controller drove a delta-sigma serial DAC (all digital). The FPGA output
> controlled an adjustable power converter which powered a thermoelectric heat pump. I didn’t really need 20 bits here,
> but it didn’t have a significant cost in hardware, and not having to worry about digital errors made the analysis
> simple. That was years ago: several manufacturers now make 24 bit delta-sigma ADCs I would consider suitable for
> temperature control.


> Some delta-sigma ADCs have differential inputs for both reference and measurement. This allows you to make a direct
> ratiometric comparison between a reference resistor and an RTD. Wire them in series, make the voltage across the
> reference resistor the reference voltage, and the voltage across the RTD the measurement. This reduces the analog
> accuracy problem to a very small number of components.
